	A CSS rule has two main parts: a selector, and one or more declarations:<br>
	<b> { property1 : value1;property2: value 2;â€¦ }<br></b>
					declaration <br>  
	Each declaration consists of a property and a value.
	The property is the style attribute you wantto change.<br>
	 Each property has a value.
	A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration groups are surrounded by curly brackets:<br>
	<b>Types of selectors</b>
<ol type="1">
<li>tag names</li>
<li>Class selectors</li>
<li>Id selectors</li>
</ol>
HTML tag names as selectors<br>
used to override the default attributes of HTML tags<br>
Format:  tag_name {property : value}
Ex.  a { color: red; 
		   text-decoration: overline
}<br>

The class selector<br>
define generic styles that can be applied to different HTML elements<br>
applied to the class attribute of HTML elements<br>
The class selector is used to specify a style for a group of elements. Unlike the id selector, the class selector is most often used on several elements. 
This allows you to set a particular style for many HTML elements with the same class. <br>



The selector is normally the HTML element you want to style.<br>
p {color:red;text-align:center;}<br>
To make the CSS more readable, you can put one declaration on each line, like this:<br>
p{color:red;text-align:center;} <br>
Selectors can be grouped (separated by comma)<br>
Ex.   p, div, table { align: center }<br>

	</div>
    </body>
