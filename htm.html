        2.1 Introduction to HTML
       <p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web.<br>
        HTML is not a programming language rather it is a markup language that tells web
        browsers how to structure the web page.<br> HTML consists of a series of elements, which
        you use to enclose, wrap or markup different parts of content to make it appear or act
        in a certain way.<br></p>
        HTML defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides
        HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or
        functionality/ behavior (JavaScript).<br>
        HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web (WWW) global information initiative
        since 1990.<br> It is a simple markup language used to create hypertext documents that are
        platform independent.<br> HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail,
        documentations, and hyper media; menus of options; database query results;
        This document covers html versions ranging from 2 up to 5
        HTML is composed of several tags.<br> HTML Document:-<br>
        - A text document containing markup tags<br>
        - The tags tell the browser how to display the document<br>
        - Should have an .htm or .html file name extension<br>
        - Can be created using a simple text editor<br>
        An HTML document has the following basic structure:
html<br>
head<br>
  
title<br>
page title<br>
title<br>
head<br>
body<br>
content<br>
body<br>
html<br>
2.2 HTML Tags
In HTML, a tag is used for creating an element. Tags are used to delimit the start and
end of elements in the markup. Normal html elements have a start tag to indicate
where they begin, and an end tag to indicate where they end. The start and end tags of
certain normal elements can be omitted. An HTML tag is composed of the name of the
element, surrounded by angle brackets (<>). An end tag also has a slash after the
opening angle bracket, to distinguish it from the start tag.
E.g.
//<p> paragraph </p>//
You may have come across the term HTML elements in this module or some other
document. You may have also seen HTML tags and HTML elements used
interchangeably. But there is a difference between the two. HTML tags are just the
opening and closing entities of an element. Whereas HTML Elements contain the
opening tag, closing tag and content (content is optional for void elements).
There are six different kinds of HTML elements. Void elements, template elements,
raw text elements, Escapable raw text elements, Foreign elements and Normal
Element
